# toys

a repo where i keep:

- a collection of weird little toys
- a bunch of creative coding tools / libs etc. that are helpful to me when
  making weird little toys

you can look at the toys here: https://alex.dytry.ch/toys

before i had this repo, i'd make a new one for each new weird little toy and
waste a bunch of time on build setup and reimplementing all my standard tools /
libs from scratch. this way is quicker. i think some of the tools here are more
generally useful, but i probably won't publish them cus i'd rather focus my
limited free time on actually making things with the tools.
